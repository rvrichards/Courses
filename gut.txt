1. Introduction to Microbes and the Human Microbiome

  Microbes
    - most numerous and diverse organisms on earth
    - gut microbes == brain, in weight, about 3 pounds.
    - effect medications, gut microbes process these in different ways
    - can also effect if a diet will work for you, effect behaviour, health,
    - some live in the earths crust, 7km down (Desulforudis audaxviator)
      - http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-23855436  (100 million years old!)
      - prokaryotes -  reproducing every 10K years! - the edge of defining what is life
    - converted our early CO2 world into an O2 world
    - help with cycle of life, decomposing organic material (carbon), helping plants to grow (nitrogen)
    - they are the only organisms that take nitrogen and convert it to usable products for plants
    - we only need fertilizer when we have depleted the microbes that do this job
    - they can clean waste water, oil spills
    - 10 orders of magnitude more microbial cells on earth than stars in the heavens.
    - no formal definition, basically to small to be seen by the naked eye
    - can be good, bad, & symbiotic. Finding out that if it seems symbiotic, it is probably good.
    - single celled organisms, can be classified as
      - bacterial - can reproduce themselves
                  - simple compared to eukaryotes
                  - love sugar as a food source, pumped into soil from plants photosynthesis
                  - dna not stored in a nucleus. Humans cells have a container inside called a nucleus.
                  - come in three shapes
                    - bascili (rods)
                    - cocsi (balls)
                    - spirals    They perform different cellular functions
                  - can make us sick, or give us vitamins, hard to tell by shape
                  - mostly solitary, but can form in groups ie film in morning mouth
      - archaea - simple compared to eukaryotes
                - dna not stored in a nucleus.
                - can reproduce themselves
                - like bacteria, only can tell apart by dna
                - can live in extreme environments (hot, cold, salty), use sulpher for food
                  - produce methane deep in a cows gut, live i
      - eukaryotes - much more complex
                - can reproduce themselves
                - dna is stored in a nucleus, like humans.
                - one major group is fungi - can be small and single celled or large & multicelled
                  - yeast is a single celled fungus, considered a microbe
                  - fingi decompose organic material, using enzymes, then absord nutrients thru cells
                  - most fungel cells are static and cannot move on their own
                - another group called protozoa, primitive algea, amoebas, slime mould
                  - hoever, they can spread using spores, and other methods
      - viruses - are at the border of what we consider living things
                - made up of genetic material, dna, & rna, inside a protein coat.
                - yhey have a nucleus
                - completely inactive until they come in contact with a host
                - they cannot reproduce without infecting a cell
                - inject their material into the host, they cannot reproduce themselves
                - much smaller than bacteria or archaea
                - ebola, common flu, swine flu


  Microbiome
    - (def) the collection of genomes of microbes in a system
    - (def) the totality of microorganisms and their collective genetic material present in a system
    - This effects many animals, it is very critical to health
    - the health of amphibians is declining because of this, natural bacteria on the skin
      - a fungal pathogen, effects the skin osmo-regulate (transferring gases and moisture)
    - changes colour of feathers, breathe thru skin.
    - flighted animals, gut mircobiome is critical for bone density & flight. what is microbes role?

    http://americangut.org/.

    10 trillion human cells
    100 trillion microbial cells
    Therefore: Our bodies only 10% human cells

    20,000 human genes
    2-20 million microbial genes
    Therefore: Our bodies only 0.1-1% human genes

    Any two people have  aboutn 99.99% same dna


  Human Microbiota

    Microbiota is the collection of organismsof a particular site, habitat, or geological period.
    The collection of trillions of mircobes living in and on the human body
    The community of microbes residing on and in the human body (all single cell)
      - bacteria
      - archaea
      - viruses
      - microeukaryotes
    Different parts of the body have different "climates" of microbes.
      - forehead - high count, low diversity
      - palm - low count, high diversity
      - nose - innocuous bacteria keep infectious bacteria at bay
      - mouth - most bacteria here is beneficial, lay down biofilms
              - fascinating biogeography, very diverse
      - gut - the mecca of microbes
        - large vs small intestines, very different microbes
      - most important ones help digest food


  Where do we get microbes from
    Different sites on the body have different biomes.
    Four major distinct areas are
      -oral (mouth)
      -skin
      -vaginal
      -gut (fecal material)
    People will have simiar % (cluster) of microbe types in these area
    Babies will not have any communities but are similar everywhere
      - if a vaginal birth, then microbes from that community
      - c-section, microbes cluster around the skin microbe types
        - studies about the health of babies c-sec vs vaginal
        - antibiotic knock out many microbes, but they bounce back



  Assignment
    List three factors and explain (in three sentences or fewer for each) why you think each might affect gut microbes.
    1. Antobiotics
    - The killing of microbes by antibiotics means that the ones that survive will have a free reign for a while to multiply. It also allows ones that survive to have some immunity for the next round of anitbiotics. An occasional dose of antibiotics is fine as they seem to bouncs back, but repeated use cannot be a good thing.
    2. Food
    - The quality of food we eat will affect the microbes. A diverse and healthy diet, free of artificial processing will allow a wider range of microbes to exist. I am going to guess that raw milk, full of microbes is much more healthy than pasteurized milk where they are sterilzed.
    3. Environment
    - An environment constantly cleansed of microbes by constantly killing them will limit the variety of microbes that we have. I am guessing that the wider the variety the better it is for us.

2. Studying the Microbiome

  History
    Man has used microbial processes: bread, beer, cheese, wine, sausage, ...
    Dutch Microbiologist Leeuwenhoek's microscopes first allowed us to peer into the bacterial world.
      - teeth scrubs, first glimpse into human micobiota
      - only could observe, so can't learn mmuch
    Robert Koch in the 1880s grew cultures, so now we can separate different kinds of bacteris
      - so now we can study an individual cultures
      - isolated disease causing bacterias (pathogen)
      - cultures this pathogen, introduced into a healthy live host, & re-isolated that pathogen
    Culture of microbes - means growth of microbes in a medium, that grow into a large number of similar cells. The medium may support a single kind or multiple kinds of microbes, even having a dye to separate microbes. But not all microbes can grom in a culture, in fact, very few can be cultured. It is very hard to differentiate microbes, you can only do it with ribosomal DNA (RNA?) Many microbes cannot be cultured.

  High Throughput DNA Sequencing
    - you can only count on morphology (shape) for limited info
    - culturing can only id limited microbes, and very few gut microbes
    - so DNA is key, it is wrapped up in a "phosphate backbone", made up of
      - A Aenine - can only pair with Thymine
      - T Thymine
      - C Cystocine - can only pair with Guanine
      - G Guanine
      - Nucleotide
    - Genome refers to all the DNA in a living organism. It is s blueprint
    - In our Genome, the DNA is organized into genes
      - genes are regions of the genome that correspond to a unit inheritance, like hair colour and blood type
      - gene is a single part of the entire blueprint of the cell.
      - sometimes multiple genes are required to set things.
      - to pass on information, genes are transcribed into messages (RNA) and translated into proteins
      - proteins do most of the work, think of machines doing the building
      - some genes are the same in all organisms, mostly important functions to make the cells work
      - other genes are specific to the organism
      - in microorganisms, this could be what the microbe uses select certain compounds as a food source.
      - in microbes, some genes are "conserved" and others are "variable"
      - the "variable parts drive the evolution of the species, or its change in time in response to the environment

    DNA-based community analysis targets a gene present in all microbial community members
      - conserved regions - a target to find all microbes. Use the "conserved" regions to pinpoint the gene
      - variable regions - allow us to distinguish between different kinds (species) of microbes.
      - 16S rRNA gene is found in all bacteria and archaea, humans do not have this gene
      - 16S rRNA gene is ~1500 nuclotides long, the V4 region
    How to?
      - Extract the DNA out of the cells
        - This requires physical and chemical processes.
        - You want to poke holes in cell membranes to extract, also "lysed" to disrupt plasma membrane
        - This mixture is then treated with protease to destroy protein and RNAase to destroy RNA.
        - This mixture is pelleted in a centrifuge. The supernantant (liquid) containing DNA is put in clean tube.
      - Make copies of  part of the 16S DNA V4 region (polymes chain reaction)
      - Sequence 16S DNA
      - Use sequences to distinguish microbes from each other
      - In your samples (ie fecal) you may also get DNA from plants or other things
      - We only want microbial DNA, throw away the rest
      - Use PCR to mimic how nature copies DNA.
    How does nature do it?
      - First it has to unwind, an enzyme called Helicase, its like a zipper unzipping the DNA
      - Next, an enzyme called DNA Polymerase comes along and finds matching base pairs.
      - So the old DNA is now split into 1/2 of the each of the new DNAs creation.
        - Need single stranded DNA as a template.
        - Need a place to start unwinding the DNA.
        - Needs free nucleotides. A G T C
    PCR Polymerase chain reaction
      - Need a "Primer" (oligonucleotide) a small piece of man-made DNA to tell PCR where to start and stop
      - This allows us to target specific genes or gene regions
      - For example, to get the V4 region of 16S, we match up a "conserved" region before and after V4 with Primers.
        1. Heat helps unzip DNA
        2. Primers attach
        3. DNA polymerase adds nucleotides
        4. DNA copies complete
      - This processes repeats and at the end we'll have 100s of millions of copies
      - We then purify, no unwanted DNA
      Sequence the remaining DNA by
        0. Making copies of the DNA, but now we keep track of the nucleotides added
        1. Fluorescently labeled nucleotides (dye & reversable blocking agent) are added one at a time.
        2. Once added it blocks all other nucleotides
        3. The dye lets us see what nucleotides get added
        4. Each base has a different colour, that a camera can see.
        5. Once the colour is detected, the nucleotides is unblocked so the process can continue
        6. Keeping track of the colour, we are keeping track of the sequence.
        7. You'll need to do 10,000s sequencing to thuroughly descibe the community.
      High output DNA sequencers do this job.

    Omic Techniques
      We want to know what microbes are doing in the gut. When we look at the gut we'll see
        - microbial eukaryote
        - food particals
        - human cells
        - bacterial cells
        - viruses

      Bacterial cells contain many molecules, which we can analyze. They come in many shapes & sizes. We'll focus on bacterial and how it effects our health.
        - we can tagret a specific gene 16s RNA which gives us a good idea of the bacteria in the gut
        - We can sequence all the DNA, called "shotgun"
        - we can sequence their entire genome
        - we learn what is present and the types of genes they have.

    Here are the techniques we use, ordered from the "beginning" to the "end"
        0. Genomics - the study of DNA
        1. Transcriptomics - study RNA
        2. Proteomics - study of proteins.
        3. Metabolomics - study of intermediates and end products of metabolism.

      1. Transcriptomics - study RNA (via sequencing). Tells us what genes in microbes are being used by mRNAs.
          Only some of the DNA in a cell is copied into messenger RNA which is the first step to make a protein. RNA is similar to DNA except in one nucleotide base: Thymine -> Uracil. IT helpds the DNA blueprints get to the place in the cell where proteins are built. It allows RNA to be more flexible than DNA. Sequencing RNA is called transcriptomics, and this provides a more accurate snapshot of the genes that are actually being used in the genomes of bacteria.

      2. Proteomics - study of proteins. Tells us what proteins are present in the gut.
          RNA is then translated into amino acids that are strung together into proteins which are the workhorse or machines of the cell. The study of proteins called proteomics. Proteins are large molecules that perform many functions including moving other molecules, signaling other cells, and initiating important chemical reactions. By identifying the proteins generated by bacteria we can even more finely tune our understanding of what bacteria are doing in the human gut. The human gut microbiome has a core of about 1,000 proteins. The proteins produced by bacteria can have influence on the physiology of the host organism i.e., health vs. disease. This technique helps understand the function of the microbial community.

          In a set of Swedish twins, one has Chrons (colon) and the other does not. One difference we've found is that the person with Chrons lacks Faecalibacterium, which is a beneficial micro-organism that creates short-chain fatty acids. This is not be the entire problem but it is an important clue.

      3. Metabolomics - study of intermediates and end products of metabolism.
          The last set of molecules include intermediates and end products of metabolism as well as hormones, signaling molecules, sugars, and lipids. The study of these is called metabolomics. v\We learn valuable insights into the products of microbial action & gut digestion. These provide insights into the human gut microbiome important diseases such as cystic fibrosis. Also host - microbe interaction.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Making Sense Out of Microbial Data

  How do identify a microbe?
    Under a microscope and how they react on an agar plate - microbes may look the same but we have found that they can be wildly different.

    E. Coli strains can have about 40% different genes! This is because some genes can be changed quite easily. This makes id challenging, but we can use the 16S genes, which encodes for the 16S rRNA molecule gene, because it is so essential for the cell.

  Taxonomy - a way of assigning organisms a place on the "tree of life".
    We can use the 16S gene to assign taxonomy. We can use the "omic" processes for assigning taxonomy. Think like a postal code, many levels of grouping. We can be very broad or very specific:

    Domain - Phylum - Class - Order - Family - Genus - Species

    We are used to seeing names of bacteria as two words, genus and species like Escherichia coli or E coli. Organisms are often grouped into operational taxonomic units or OTUs

  Differential coverage bwhere you can use that pattern of relative abundance as a signature. These provide very robust pictures of the community.


  Diversity of microbes in a Community.
    Alpha Diversity - describes how many organisms there are in a sample and how abundant they are.
    Shannon and Simpson Diversity - used to describe diversity in ecosystems, richness & evenness.
    Faith's phylogenetic distance - accounts for phylogeny - where they are in family tree.

      The more diversity in a community, the stronger it is and the more functions it performs. This is functional redundancy. Also, if one species goes extinct, another can take over some of its functions. Also, they are resistent to invasion of exotic species or pathogens that come in and try to take over.

      When examining a community, you can't sequence them all, you can only do a part. The more samples the better, however, the results will plateau and you can't sequence (using the 16S sequences) them all, so finding where you plateau will give good results. Sequencing costs money & time.

      Gut microbial communities are very complex, so we need to sample them deeply to understand who's there. This is why higher throughput sequencing is important. In two different studies of the same community, sampling will play a role in diffeences. Comparing studies need to have closer sampling levels. This is called rarefaction. You can lose info of the community if one study had 20 samples and another 5, but you could only rareifty the 20 sample study, to 5 to make valid comparisons.

      Beta Diversity
        This is the similarity or diversity between two samples. A lower beta diversity means that the communities are more similar and a higher beta diversity means that the two communities have little in common. Also, the phylogenetic tree accounts for diversity too.
        Typically, the more diverse the environment the less similar two communities are.

        Unifrag - Is using the phylogenetic tree as a measuring stick to, to tell how similar or dissimilar different communities are.

      Visualizing differences - contingency tables are used.
        Rows have microbe counts (features) and columns have different samples. We can use 3D plots and use math to see how close communitites are to each other, in 3D space. This works well if we have 3 rows, but more rows we can't visualize (ie 6 features or dimensions) but we can still perform the math. Square of difference of each feature over the two samples - for each 6 rows, and square-root the sum of this. Visualization is important for us to see patterns.

        We can use dimensionality reduction, to try and find patterns are in the data, but reduce the number of dimensions we need to see that pattern. Use a different cordinate system, ie like a circle & express in degrees.

        PCS - principal components analysis
        PCOA - principal coordinates analysis

  Question/Answers
    We use the 16S rRNA gene to assign taxonomy to bacteria because:
      It is highly conserved, evolving very slowly, which allows for classification of taxa in the highly diverse domain of bacteria


    What is the purpose of rarefying samples?
      To ensure even sampling across samples and studies to make comparisons more valid

    Why do we need so many sequences per sample for gut microbiome research?
        Gut microbial communities are very diverse and must be sampled deeply to be described accurately

    What is beta diversity?
         A measure of the dissimilarity of microbial communities between two different samples

    What is dimensionality reduction?
         Finding a new presentation of the data that captures the same patterns in the data in fewer dimensions

4. The Human Gut Microbiome and Your Health

  The main factors that change the micorbiota.
    - age, diet, antibiotics, genetics, and physiology.
    - a colder gut influences the microbiota that we have.
    - eating protein vs carbs makes a difference
    - We all start with a sterile gut, and accumulate microbes during & after birth.
    - It can change from one day to another, depending who we come in contact with
    - When we are adults the microbial communites are quite complex.
    - In old age we lose some microbial community from day-day and week-week.
    - Diet, both short term and long term will change the gut.
    - Long term - over a year.
      - Carbohydrates - pasta, potatoes, and sugars - have a lot of prevotella bacteria
      - Protein - meat - people have bacteroides bacteria
    - short term diet changes do have an effect
      - mostly meat eater vs vegan showed a big swing
      - meat eaters picked up lots of hemophela, which is associated with cardiovascual problems.
      - still in infancy, so still learning, bu holds promise for future

    Antibiotics stop bacteria from doing things, which is not good. But they can pick up resistance. They target all bacteria, both good and bad. People will recover at different rates, even after a year there is still some effect. Some can recover in a few weeks.

    Probiotics are also popular and can help. They are live microorganisms that benefit health when they're administered in sufficient quantities. Sometimes they are a single strain, and sometimes they are fungal microbes(?)  Not only can they help alleviate some gastrointestinal problems they also appear to be able to help against obesity or mood disorders. But we can't say definitively.

    Genetics versus the environment. There is mixed results on how out genes effect microbes. There are some ways of testing, but they can be potentially be unethical. It has been shown that some genes can change the relative abundance of specific kinds of bacteria in the gut. One example is lactobacillus - some people can process dairy better than others.

    The last major factor influencing the gut microbiota is our physiology. This refers to factors like hormone levels, immune system function, metabolism, et cetera.

  Obesity & Gut Microbiota
    The food we consume effect the microbiome. Leptin deficient mice cannot process when they have eaten enough. Consequently they get very fat. There are phylum level changes in the microbial communities. There is a increase in firmicutes and a decreased representation of bacteroidetes. So what were these microbes doing? Microbes have an ability to digest molecules in our food that our own human bodies cannot.

    Microbes contain genes that produce enzymes to digest these components, such as complex polysaccharides, where as humans do not possess those genes in our own genome. Researchers found that the microbes in an obese community were able to extract significantly more energy then microbes in a lean community. The obese community mocrobes were enriched with genes related to energy harvesting, especially from carbohydrates and lipids. However, this does not show causation.

    Scientists use gnotobiotic mice, mice that are sterile, raised inspecial bacteria free chambers. Scientists can colonize these mice with new microbes. They put microbes from the lean mice in one set and the microbes from the obese mice in another and feed them the same amount. The mice with lean microbes were lean and the ones given obese microbes were obese. So the microbes were better at extracting energy from the food in the obese mice case.

    Our body's immune system has receptors that help it recognize bacteria. Like the toll-like receptor 5 or TLR5 for short. It also appears that the genetic richness of our microbiome will have an effect on obesity. Lean individuals have microbes that have more genes. Lean microbial communities had a decrease in the number of butyrate producing bacteria, an increased ability to degrade the lining inside the gastrointestinal tract, reduced hydrogen and methane production, increased Campylobacter Shigella abundances, and an increased potential to manage oxidative stress.

  Microbial disabliers
    Most microbes are good or harmless, but some are not. Because so many are good, we remain healthy, a state called Homeostasis. When you get sick, more bad ones called pathogens will emerge. This state is called dysbiosis. The immune system responds with such things are inflammation. Our gut microbe diversity decreases. People with chronic diseases also have less microbe diversity.

    The two most common types of IBD, or inflammatory bowel disease disease are Chron's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis. With IBD parts of the small intestine, or parts of the colon are chronically inflamed. The microbe communities are different, and different again from healthy people. The two IBDs have microbes that are performing different tasks. Antobiotics in Chrons patients actually lead to more extreme dysbosis. In colon cancer patients, Fusobacterium nucleatum (an anaerobe it thrives with little to no oxygen) is found in elevated levels, much higher then that of healthy people. Interesting is that it is frequently in the mouth of healthy people where it's a normal constituent of the oral microbiota. It is also seen mostly in carnivores, like dogs in much higher levels than humans. We are not sure if it is a cause or an effect. There are also other microbes that seem to blossom in the presence of colon cancer. Much to learn, all we can say now, is that when the microbe community is not diverse, it is not healthy.

    Fecal transplants have been wildly successful for curing people with infections of Clostridium difficile. It usually kills about 14,000 people a year. Ongoing research is showing that antibiotics can do serious damage to the microbiome and should only be taken if necessary.

    Oxalobacter - a microbe that is dissappearing in Western cultures. It eats oxalate, which is how kidney stones get started. There is a corresponding rise in kidney stones in the US. Modernity starting from chlorinated water, and antibacterial substances and fluids and antibiotic widespread use of antibiotics in our society are probably the reason for the demise of Oxalobacter in the USA.

    The human food project - Jeff Leach. (http://humanfoodproject.com/)  Help the public better understand health. Field work to see the microbiome of indigeneous populations. He is at a hunter gather community the Hadzabe, one of the last in the world. They have been doing this for 1000s of years. They have a very fibre diet. They are not walled off in buildings & modernity. He has changed his diet, and the microbe responds quite rapidly.

  Missing Microbes: How the Overuse of Antibiotics Is Fueling Our Modern Plagues
    The microbiome is quite different in USA as opposed to ancient microbiome and different parts of the world. How can we get them back to beinh healthy? There is a natural trajectory and one that is changed after antibiotics, or a vaginal vs cesarian section. We can get off of these tracks, be on an altered trajectory. One method is fecal transplants, another is probiotics, and even a fibre diet that encourage good bacteria to flourish. There are opportunistic microbes that thrive after antibiotic use. It used to be a last resort, now its the first line for Clostridium difficile infections. Very successful.

  Question/Answers

      true

    True or False? A fecal transplant can be considered a type of probiotic
     true

    Which of the following is a true statement about the effect of antibiotics on the gut microbiota?

    It is found in high abundances near tumors in the colon

    The gut microbiota of the elderly is characterized by:
    High diversity and low stability

    How do antibiotics affect weight?
    Babies treated with antibiotics within the first six months of life end up weighing more

    What happens when we put gut microbes from an obese human into germ-free mice?
    The mice gain weight

5. Gut Microbe-Host Interactions: Beyond Nutrition

  Gut microbiota interactions with the immune system
    It appears that the gut microbiota may be critical for our immune system to function correctly. The immune system is composed of two main parts. The innate immune system and the adaptive immune system.

    The innate immune system is non specific, it defends against all pathogens the same way no matter what they are. The innate immune system is made up of physical barriers like our skin, as well as chemicals in the blood that react against anything deemed foreign.

    The adaptive immune system is specific. It tests cells to determine if they are foreign or not and mounts a defense against whatever specific type of pathogen it encounters. Cells called helper T-cells perform this task by testing and sending chemical signals called cytokines to tell the immune system how to respond.  It also has a memory so once in contact with a pathogen, it remembers and can react against it quickly. Vaccines work by presenting deactivated forms of common pathogens so when the real thing comes along, its got an edge.

    Cytokines are a broad category of small proteins that are important in cell signaling. They are released by cells and affect the behavior of other cells. They are often studied in any immune system research. They are sensed and produced by neurons.

    Within adaptive systems, there are humoral immune responses and cell-mediated responses. Cytokines modulate the balance between humoral and cell-based immune responses

  Auto-immune & Gut microbiota
    Humoral immunity targets pathogens found outside of our human cells. For example, in our blood it looks for bacteria, fungus and worms. Humoral immunity involves B cells, which tag pathogenic cells as invaders. This is where the term antibody comes from. Antobodies are Y shaped proteins, and every different antibody recognizes a specific foreign antigen. Cells called helper T Cells help recognize projections on pathogen cell walls called antigens and direct B-cells to create other proteins, antibodies, that latch onto the antigens and identify the pathogen. This tags pathogens for other immune cells to destroy them.

    Cell-mediated immunity in contrast to humoral immunity, targets pathogens that are found inside of ourselves. These are things like viruses. Cells with pathogens inside of them send signals. As part of cell-mediated immunity colored T cells recognize these cells and incite infected cells to self destruct.

    The gut microbiota interacts constantly with the adaptive immune system. Our immune system has to know that some gut microbes although foresign are not pathogenic. It does this by testing the produces the secretion of antibodies, called immunoglobulin or IGA. These antibodies are specific to certain strains of microbes and are used by B cells to tag pathogenic invaders. So it protects the good microbiota by the type of antibodies the immune system generates. Also, the gut microbes also incite the immune system to create IGA antibodies. Immune cells in the intestinal wall are constantly monitoring the gut microbes.

    Germ-free animals and newborns have far fewer cells that create antibodies, so it appears that the gut microbiota actually stimulates the immune system. In fact beneficial gut microbes produce chemicals that attack pathogens, and some beneficial gut microbes incite T cells to react to pathogens.

    Use of antibiotics reduce the effectiveness of the immune system in future attacks. Basically if you're too clean your immune system doesn't get trained correctly and it overreacts to non pathogenic foreign cells.

    But gut microbes can also do damage. There is a mucus layer in the intestine that keeps microbes out and the immune cells in the intestinal wall are constantly monitoring the gut microbes. But if one gets past all that, it is now a problem and becomes an infection. The immune system kicks in, specifically the innate immune system attacks anything that crosses into the body from the gut. The adaptive immune system will target specific bacteria with antibodies to kill them. This can happen if our intestine becomes inflammed from food we eat and microbes leak through.

    Think about how complex this all is. Like knowing what gut microbes are good, but when they cross into the body, they are now an enemy.


  Gut microbiota, autoimmune diseases, and allergies
    Gut microbes affect auto-immune diseases, which is when the immune system mistakes healthy tissue cells or organs as foreign. This includes Celiacs disease, Crohn's disease, Lupus, Multiple sclerosis, Rheumatoid arthritis, and Type 1 Diabetes. Microbial factors into this complex situation.

    People with Crohn's disease have very different gut microbes, typically lots of E.Coli and related microbes. It is believed that it is the process by which Chrons develops. It often occurs more often in woman. Estrogen is believe to be a key in this.

    Studies appear to show that microbes can regulate the development of autoimmune disease. One such was supplanting adult male mice fecal microbes into young female mice and the auto-immune diseases were significantly lower than in the normal young female mouse.

    When bacteria from another mouse or another organism such as a human are transferred to germ free mice, these mice are called gnotobiatic mice. This is an important tool is studying these microbe immune system response.

    Food allergies are inappropriate immune responses to food particles that are mediated by an antibody called immunoglobulin E, or by T cells. The most common food allergies are milk, peanut, egg, tree nut, soy, fish, wheat, and shellfish allergies. But why?

    Research shows that early exposure to bacteria in pet dander, dirt, and other environmental particles reduces a child's chances of developing skin and respiratory allergies. This is because microbes play an important role in the immune system response.

    Food allergies are associated with a specific gut microbe signature. This is a complex arrangement.

  Immune & Nervous System & Microbes
    The immune system and the nervous system have many similarities, amoung them that they learn from their environment. We know that microbes interact with the immune system and it seems that they also affect the nervous system. Autism Spectrum Disorder research seems to show this to be true.

    70% of your peripheral neurons go through the gut. That means 30% of your neurons cover taste, touch, pain, heartbeat, and breathing. Amazing. So the gut microbes do have access to the brain! The enteric nervous system is what monitors the gut, which has direct access to the central nervous system, the brain and spinal chord.

    Mice raised in germ free environments have underdeveloped tissues architecture, even into adulthood, such things as the spleen are underdeveloped. Its a two way street between microbes and the nervous system. This means therapies may involve gut microbes in Autism Spectrum Disorder cases.

    One study of a particular molecule called polysaccharide A (PSA) which is produced by bacteris flagellus which is a common human gut bacteria. Turns out this is required for a good functioning immune system. It interacts with an immune cell called a regulatory T-cell. These cells are pro inflammatory in nature and PSA are very specific in interacting with a subset of T-cells.

    When we get cut, the adaptive immune system is trying to fight off microbes, and it causes damage to good cells because it can't distinguish between a microbial cell and our own cells. Its a war, think of collateral damage.

    Concerning allergies, if the immune system becomes activated in the absense of infection (T-cell action), tissue damage is done that results in us seeing the symptoms associated with these diseases (multiple sclerosis and lupus and type 1 diabetes). Now the anti-inflammatory arm of the T-cell kicks in.

    The main hypothesis for the reason why people don't have MS is that we have a good balance between the pro-inflammatory cells (T-cell#1) that cause tissue damage. The anti-inflammatory cells (T-cell#2) which are the brake on the immune system, which prevent uncontrolled inflammation, there is a defect. This brake not working is the problem. PSA is involved with this brake, and this presents exciting new therapies in the fight of auto-immune diseases. Again, there are microbial molecules which activate beneficial arms of the immune system.

    Germ free mice have more T-cell#2 vs T-cell#1, whereas a healthy balance is an equal number ot #1 and #2 T-cells.

    If we can now harness PSA activity, we can boost the regulatory T-cell response, we can boost the anti-inflammatory response, which is missing in patients with allergies and autoimmunity

  Auto-immune & HIV
    HIV patients have chronic inflammation or an activated state in the gut. This is the pro-inflammation part of the T-cell. HIV patients also have quite a different gut microbial community throughtout all the regions of the gut, then on average. Even with therapies, their microbes are not returning. Specifically the microbes that produce the anti-inflammatory reaction are not there.

    It appears that the cells that HIV targets, compromise these T-cells and the microbes seem to rely on them being there, and when they are not there (ie compromised) these microbes seem to die off and are not present. They seem to depend on each other. Current research is to confirm this & why. This is not a passive relationship!

    Autism Spectrum Disorder is much harder to understand than HIV, because of the word spectrum. There is current research to see in these patients with gastro problems also, if a fecal translpant therapy will effect behaviour. Amazing.

  The Gut-Brain Axis
    There is a 2 way communication between the brain and the gut. These paths include Immune system, Endocrine function, and Neural pathways.

    1. Immune cells in the gut sense bacteria in the Lumen which influence the auto-immune to make T-cells produce cytokines. Cytokines levels can lead to changes in the brain.
    2. Also gut microbes can activate cells in the intestinal walls that produce peptides (short immuno acid chains). These can actually activate nerve endings.
    3. Finally, microbes can send direct messages by producing neurotransmitters. In other words they're signaling the molecules that your nervous system uses.

    Microbes can make chemicals that allow them to speak the brain's language. 90% of serotonin is in the gut, 10% is in your brain.

    Under stress, your brain will release corticosteroids which affect gut immune cells. This can cause microbes to leak into your bloodstream and effect the whole body.

    Microbes can also change behaviour, studies show the the gut microbes change eating behaviour, creating very obese mice. Giving mice antibiotice or probiotics make them less aggressive.

    The same was seen in fruit flies. A diet of sweet vs starch showed that the flies preferred to mate only with similar eating flies. The only difference? Bacteria in the fly and the food!

    Children with autism spectrum disorder (ADS) preliminary evidence that children may have different microbes in the gut than the their brothers and sisters. There is a relationship, but the causality is unclear. Autism is often accompanied by gut problems.

    Germ free mice do poorly under stress then do mice with normal gut microbiota.

    Depression is linked to the immune system. Microbes can influence and regulate immune responses, the microbiome may be a source of therapy.

    People taking probiotics with lactobacillus and bifidobacterium (beneficial bacteria in large amounts in infants) showed the substantial reductions in anxiety symptoms.
